Hello, my name is Marten Dreger, welcome to my repository.

I am from Germany and a mechanical engineer by profession. I have worked in the premium manufacturing industry for 7 years before deciding to pursue further education abroad.

While doing my MBA study at National Taiwan University in Taipei, Taiwan I discovered my passion for programming and ever since, I have made it my mission to learn as much as I possibly can about it and pursue my further career in this field.

Here I will showcase some of my projects, feel free to contact me about them in case of any questions.
